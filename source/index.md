# Introduction

##MineWhatâ€™s API

The MineWhat API is the interface that a developer can use to send or recieve and data from our system. We make periodical updates to the API. See the changelog for more details.
 
##Access

All calls to the API require an access_token that defines the customer making the call. Any registered MineWhat user can get this token from the API settings page on their account

You could use the API to either send transactional data to our servers and increase insight accuracy or you could use it to extract validated data from any of the insights. Please visit the website for more info on product features.
